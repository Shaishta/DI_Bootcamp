        <li>What is Lorem Ipsum?</li>
        <li2>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, </li2>
       <li>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </li>
    </ul>
</div1>

<div2>
    <p1>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,</p1>
    <ol>
        <li> remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets </li>
    </ol>
    <p2> containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p2>
